//@content directive ---> is used to get content written inside the specific mixin's block and it also pastes the name of the 
//css declaration in which we include the mixin inside of!!!
//@if directive is used to check for conditions!!
//instead of writing all the media queries inside of one single file we can use the power of mixin to include it wherever we want in the entire
//code
//another important thing to keep in mind is that with media queries the rems and em dont work the same way
//unlike in the entire stylesheet where 1rem = 62.5% of 16px(default browser font-size), in media queries 1rem = 100% of default font-size 
//which means it does not consider root font-size to be what we declared but it considers the default font-size provided by the browser!!!
//and you should use em instead of rem because rems dont work very well in case of media queries!!!
